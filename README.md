# Species distribution models in R

I developed the content in this repository for a 1 week workshop with the group [Clubes de Ciencias](https://clubesdeciencia.mx/en/). The first R script is a more general *introduction to programming in R*, while the other focus on creating species distribution models.

Each day of the workshop, we worked through 1 or 2 of the R notebooks contained in the repository.  My co-teacher and I also created presentations to accompnay each day of coding. 

If you would like to suggest changes or modify content at all, please do so through either a GitHub issue, pull request, or send me a message.
